=============================================================================
                   Release OpenCV beta 2.1, Friday, November 30, 2001
=============================================================================

>>> New features/functionality: <<<

  -  IPL is not required nor by OpenCV neither by demos anymore
     (even under Win32 and even in default configuration).
     Tests still need it. To get into full IPL-compatibility mode, call
     CV_TURN_ON_IPL_COMPABILITY() on your program startup. It is needed only if
     the code mix OpenCV/IPL image allocation/deallocation functions. 

  -  Makefiles to build cv, cvaux and highgui libraries with Visual C++ 6.0,
     Borland C++ 5.5 (free), Intel C++ Compiler 5.0 and Mingw GNU C++ 2.95.3 added.   
  -  Arithmetic and logical operations (w/o mask support) were optimized using
     MMX and SSE instructions.
  -  Positions of depth and numchannels flags in CvMat "type" field were exchanged.
     Now CV_8U == CV_8UC1, CV_32F == CV_32FC1 etc.
  -  Definition of rows/height and cols/width fields of CvMat was changed to provide
     C -> C++ code compatibility.
  -  Non-planar objects support added into cvFindExtrinsicParams 
  -  A few more color transforms bgr/rgb <-> gray added.
  -  New function cvRand for filling CvMat/IplImage with uniformly distributed
     random numbers added
  -  New function cvResize for image zooming/shrinking with nearest-neigbor
     or bilinear interpolation was added
  -  Texture descriptors calculation was added to cvaux library.
  -  Faster image segmentation was added to cvaux library
  -  new ippcv binaries included (previous release contained somewhat outdated binaries).
  -  calibration filter uses batch-mode undistortion now (cvUnDistortInit + cvUnDistort)
  -  C++ calibration + stereo rectification class was added to cvaux.

>>> Here is the list of fixed bugs: <<<

  -  3x3 matrix inversion was incorrect
  -  minmaxloc returned wrong extrema positions in case of
     continuous input arrays (i.e. w/o gaps between subsequent rows)
  -  arithmetic operations cvAddS and cvSub[R]S produce wrong result on small
     input arguments
  -  the package could not be built with gcc 2.96 under linux
  -  cvFillImage function was missed 
  -  cvRound, cvFloor and cvCeil functions worked incorrectly
     when 80-bit internal precision was set (it is a default mode under Linux).
     Also, the function were slightly inaccurate even with 64-bit internal precision set.
  -  cvRound, cvFloor, cvCeil and cvSetIdentity functions worked incorrectly at
     big-endian processors (i.e. on processors, where the most significant byte goes first)
  -  Several pieces in the library were not portable to 64-bit processors
  -  cvFindChessBoardCornerGuesses could not find chess board in some particular cases.
     The current solution is just some workaround and playing with thresholds.
     Better method is ahead.

The following problems still exist:
======================================
1. FitEllipse doesn't work properly when input points are almost on the single line.
   In alpha 3.4 it output infinite values. In this release it outputs all zeros.

2. FindFundamentalMatrix - the same. Inaccurate result in some cases.
 

=============================================================================
                   Release OpenCV beta 2, Friday, August 14, 2001
=============================================================================

  1. CvMat structure can be used passed to almost any function that accepts IplImages
     and vice versa. It is done via introduction of dummy type CvArr which is synonym
     for void*.
  2. The following basic matrix/image operations were added:
      arithmetics (+,-,*)
      logic (and,or,xor)
      helper operations (copy,set,mirror)
      color transforms

      arithmetics (+,-) and logic operations accept mask as an optional parameter

  3. The library reference manual has been restructurized. Now all the material is
     divided into programmer guide and function reference. Each of these parts
     is split into 6-7 major areas, covered by the library.

  4. Image statistics, background accumulation and some other function groups
     extended to handle wider sets of images/matrices formats.

  5. Mask support added to cvGoodFeaturesToTrack

  6. Drawing functions can now be used with floating-point images and extended
     with 4-connectivity variants (connectivity is passed as an optional parameter).
     cvDrawContours accept negative maximal level value, which means draw (or paint)
     the passed contour and all its children up to abs(max_level) level, so
     hack with clearing h_next field during connected components labeling is not
     need any more.

  7. cvSVD improved. It can now handle both m >= n and m < n cases and it is faster
     than the previous variant. cvPseudoInv function is added that calculates
     pseudo-inverse for given matrix (Only m >= n is handled properly right now).

  8. cvSeqPush[Front] and cvSeqInsert return pointer to the inserted element.

  9. More experimental stuff has been added (including graph traversal functions,
     etc). It resides in the separate library CvAux

  10. Morphology functions speeded up (arbitrary structuring element case).

>>>Here is list of bug fixes:<<<

  I. OpenCV begins use new IPP libraries. Because IPP works not only on Win32
     systems, but under Linux as well, it allows to use IA32-optimized codes
     under Linux. The IPP binaries are called ippa6.dll,ippm6.so etc.

  II.Calibration application by Chris Halsall has been included into Linux version
     of the library. Visit www.wabbit.com/ocv for more information and updates.

  III. We moved to IPL v.2.2.

  IV. Vision Scripting Environment (a.k.a Hawk) has been included into package.
      It is application that integrates C iterpreter (modified version of
      EiC. Original EiC site is located at http://www.kd-dev.com/~eic/),
      simple graphic library (highgui) and OpenCV+IPL (but, actually, any shared
      library can be attached to the application as plugin).
      The application allows write and run short scripts in C
      and see graphical results. Look at doc\Hawk.pdf for details.

  V. Updated calibration toolbox for MATLAB has been included into the package.

  VI. Adaptive threshold and draft code for planar subdivisions (delaunay triangulation &
     voronoi tesselation) have been added to the library.

  VII. More than half of manual has been refined, many bugs/misprints have been fixed.
       It is put to doc\OpenCV_new.pdf file. Old version is still available, because
       it is more complete for the moment.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  VIIIa. The following bugs have been fixed:
  1. cvFloodFill works incorrectly with images, which height is 2.

  VIIIb. The following bugs are still present in the library:
