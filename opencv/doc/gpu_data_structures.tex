\cvCppFunc{gpu::createContinuous}
Creates continuous matrix in GPU memory.

\cvdefCpp{void createContinuous(int rows, int cols, int type, GpuMat\& m);}
\begin{description}
\cvarg{rows}{Row count.}
\cvarg{cols}{Column count.}
\cvarg{type}{Type of the matrix.}
\cvarg{m}{Destination matrix. Will be only reshaped if it has proper type and area (\texttt{rows} $\times$ \texttt{cols}).}
\end{description}

Matrix is called continuous if its elements are stored continuously, i.e. wuthout gaps in the end of each row.
