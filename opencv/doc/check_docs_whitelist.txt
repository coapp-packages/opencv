# this is a list of functions, classes and methods
# that are not supposed to be documented in the near future,
# to make the output of check_docs.py script more sensible.
#
# Syntax:
#    every line starting with # is a comment
#    there can be empty lines
#    each line includes either a class name (including all the necessary namespaces),
#                              or a function/method name
#                              or a full declaration of a function/method
#    if a class name is in the whitelist, all the methods are considered "white-listed" too
#    if a method/function name is listed, then all the overload variants are "white-listed".
#    that is, to white list a particular overloaded variant of a function/method you need to put
#    full declaration into the file
