LoadImage
---------






.. cfunction:: IplImage* cvLoadImage(  const char* filename,  int iscolor=CV_LOAD_IMAGE_COLOR )

    Loads an image from a file as an IplImage.





    
    :param filename: Name of file to be loaded. 
    
    
    :param iscolor: Specific color type of the loaded image: 
         
            * **CV_LOAD_IMAGE_COLOR** the loaded image is forced to be a 3-channel color image 
            
            * **CV_LOAD_IMAGE_GRAYSCALE** the loaded image is forced to be grayscale 
            
            * **CV_LOAD_IMAGE_UNCHANGED** the loaded image will be loaded as is. 
            
            
    
    
    
The function 
``cvLoadImage``
loads an image from the specified file and returns the pointer to the loaded image. Currently the following file formats are supported:


    

*
    Windows bitmaps - BMP, DIB
    

*
    JPEG files - JPEG, JPG, JPE
    

*
    Portable Network Graphics - PNG
    

*

*
    Sun rasters - SR, RAS
    

*
    TIFF files - TIFF, TIF
    
    
Note that in the current implementation the alpha channel, if any, is stripped from the output image, e.g. 4-channel RGBA image will be loaded as RGB.


.. index:: LoadImageM

.. _LoadImageM:

LoadImageM

.. index:: SaveImage

.. _SaveImage:

SaveImage
---------






.. cfunction:: int cvSaveImage( const char* filename, const CvArr* image )

    Saves an image to a specified file.





    
    :param filename: Name of the file. 
    
    
    :param image: Image to be saved. 
    
    
    
The function 
``cvSaveImage``
saves the image to the specified file. The image format is chosen based on the 
``filename``
extension, see 
:ref:`LoadImage`
. Only 8-bit single-channel or 3-channel (with 'BGR' channel order) images can be saved using this function. If the format, depth or channel order is different, use 
``cvCvtScale``
and 
``cvCvtColor``
to convert it before saving, or use universal 
``cvSave``
to save the image to XML or YAML format.



.. index:: CvCapture

.. _CvCapture:

CvCapture
---------



.. ctype:: CvCapture



Video capturing structure.



.. cfunction:: typedef struct CvCapture CvCapture

    


The structure 
``CvCapture``
does not have a public interface and is used only as a parameter for video capturing functions.


.. index:: CaptureFromCAM

.. _CaptureFromCAM:

CaptureFromCAM
--------------






.. cfunction:: CvCapture* cvCaptureFromCAM( int index )

    Initializes capturing a video from a camera.





    
    :param index: Index of the camera to be used. If there is only one camera or it does not matter what camera is used -1 may be passed. 
    
    
    
The function 
``cvCaptureFromCAM``
allocates and initializes the CvCapture structure for reading a video stream from the camera. Currently two camera interfaces can be used on Windows: Video for Windows (VFW) and Matrox Imaging Library (MIL); and two on Linux: V4L and FireWire (IEEE1394).

To release the structure, use 
:ref:`ReleaseCapture`
.



.. index:: CaptureFromFile

.. _CaptureFromFile:

CaptureFromFile
---------------






.. cfunction:: CvCapture* cvCaptureFromFile( const char* filename )

    Initializes capturing a video from a file.





    
    :param filename: Name of the video file. 
    
    
    
The function 
``cvCaptureFromFile``
allocates and initializes the CvCapture structure for reading the video stream from the specified file. Which codecs and file formats are supported depends on the back end library. On Windows HighGui uses Video for Windows (VfW), on Linux ffmpeg is used and on Mac OS X the back end is QuickTime. See VideoCodecs for some discussion on what to expect and how to prepare your video files.

After the allocated structure is not used any more it should be released by the 
:ref:`ReleaseCapture`
function.


.. index:: GetCaptureProperty

.. _GetCaptureProperty:

GetCaptureProperty
------------------






.. cfunction:: double cvGetCaptureProperty( CvCapture* capture, int property_id )

    Gets video capturing properties.

    :param capture: video capturing structure. 
    
    
    
The function 
``cvGrabFrame``
grabs the frame from a camera or file. The grabbed frame is stored internally. The purpose of this function is to grab the frame 
*quickly*
so that syncronization can occur if it has to read from several cameras simultaneously. The grabbed frames are not exposed because they may be stored in a compressed format (as defined by the camera/driver). To retrieve the grabbed frame, 
:ref:`RetrieveFrame`
should be used.



.. index:: QueryFrame

.. _QueryFrame:

QueryFrame
----------






.. cfunction:: IplImage* cvQueryFrame( CvCapture* capture )

    Grabs and returns a frame from a camera or file.





    
    :param capture: video capturing structure. 
    
    
    
The function 
``cvQueryFrame``
grabs a frame from a camera or video file, decompresses it and returns it. This function is just a combination of 
:ref:`GrabFrame`
and 
:ref:`RetrieveFrame`
, but in one call. The returned image should not be released or modified by the user.  In the event of an error, the return value may be NULL.


.. index:: ReleaseCapture

``cvReleaseCapture``
releases the CvCapture structure allocated by 
:ref:`CaptureFromFile`

.. index:: CreateVideoWriter

.. _CreateVideoWriter:

CreateVideoWriter
-----------------






.. cfunction:: typedef struct CvVideoWriter CvVideoWriter CvVideoWriter* cvCreateVideoWriter(  const char* filename,  int fourcc,  double fps,  CvSize frame_size,  int is_color=1 )

    Creates the video file writer.





    
    :param filename: Name of the output video file. 
    
    
    :param fourcc: 4-character code of codec used to compress the frames. For example, ``CV_FOURCC('P','I','M,'1')``  is a MPEG-1 codec, ``CV_FOURCC('M','J','P','G')``  is a motion-jpeg codec etc.
        Under Win32 it is possible to pass -1 in order to choose compression method and additional compression parameters from dialog. Under Win32 if 0 is passed while using an avi filename it will create a video writer that creates an uncompressed avi file. 
    
    
    :param fps: Framerate of the created video stream. 
    
    
    :param frame_size: Size of the  video frames.

The function 
``cvCreateVideoWriter``
creates the video writer structure.

Which codecs and file formats are supported depends on the back end library. On Windows HighGui uses Video for Windows (VfW), on Linux ffmpeg is used and on Mac OS X the back end is QuickTime. See VideoCodecs for some discussion on what to expect.
