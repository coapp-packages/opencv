    :param windowName: Name of the window which will be used as a parent for created trackbar. 
    
    
    :param value: Pointer to an integer variable, whose value will reflect the position of the slider. Upon creation, the slider position is defined by this variable. 
    
    
    :param count: Maximal position of the slider. Minimal position is always 0. 
    
    
    :param onChange: 
        Pointer to the function to be called every time the slider changes position.
        This function should be prototyped as  ``void Foo(int);``   Can be NULL if callback is not required. 
    
    
    
The function 
``cvCreateTrackbar``
creates a trackbar (a.k.a. slider or range control) with the specified name and range, assigns a variable to be syncronized with trackbar position and specifies a callback function to be called on trackbar position change. The created trackbar is displayed on the top of the given window.

qt-specific details:


    
    * **windowName** Name of the window which will be used as a parent for created trackbar. Can be NULL if the trackbar should be attached to the control panel. 
    
    
    
The created trackbar is displayed at the bottom of the given window if 
*windowName*
is correctly provided, or displayed on the control panel if 
*windowName*
is NULL.

By clicking on the label of each trackbar, it is possible to edit the trackbar's value manually for a more accurate control of it.

The function 
``cvNamedWindow``
creates a window which can be used as a placeholder for images and trackbars. Created windows are referred to by their names.

If a window with the same name already exists, the function does nothing.
\
\
**[Qt Backend Only]**
qt-specific details:


    
    * **flags** Flags of the window. Currently the supported flags are: 
        
                              
            * **CV_WINDOW_NORMAL or CV_WINDOW_AUTOSIZE:**   ``CV_WINDOW_NORMAL``  let the user resize the window, whereas   ``CV_WINDOW_AUTOSIZE``  adjusts automatically the window's size to fit the displayed image (see  :ref:`ShowImage` ), and the user can not change the window size manually. 
            
                             
            * **CV_WINDOW_FREERATIO or CV_WINDOW_KEEPRATIO:** ``CV_WINDOW_FREERATIO``  adjust the image without respect the its ration, whereas  ``CV_WINDOW_KEEPRATIO``  keep the image's ratio. 
            
                             
            * **CV_GUI_NORMAL or CV_GUI_EXPANDED:**   ``CV_GUI_NORMAL``  is the old way to draw the window without statusbar and toolbar, whereas  ``CV_GUI_EXPANDED``  is the new enhance GUI. 
            
            
        
        This parameter is optional. The default flags set for a new window are  ``CV_WINDOW_AUTOSIZE`` ,  ``CV_WINDOW_KEEPRATIO`` , and  ``CV_GUI_EXPANDED`` .
        
        However, if you want to modify the flags, you can combine them using OR operator, ie: 
        
        
        ::
        
        
            
            cvNamedWindow( ``myWindow'',  ``CV_WINDOW_NORMAL``   textbar   ``CV_GUI_NORMAL`` );

``cvSetTrackbarPos``
sets the position of the specified trackbar.
\
\
**[Qt Backend Only]**
qt-specific details:


    
    * **windowName** Name of the window which is the parent of trackbar.  Can be NULL if the trackbar is attached to the control panel. 
    
    
    

.. index:: ShowImage

.. _ShowImage:

ShowImage
---------






.. cfunction:: void cvShowImage( const char* name, const CvArr* image )

    Displays the image in the specified window





    
    :param name: Name of the window. 
    
    
    :param image: Image to be shown. 
    
    
    
The function 
``cvShowImage``
displays the image in the specified window. If the window was created with the 
``CV_WINDOW_AUTOSIZE``
flag then the image is shown with its original size, otherwise the image is scaled to fit in the window. The function may scale the image, depending on its depth:


    

*
    If the image is 8-bit unsigned, it is displayed as is.
        
    

*
    If the image is 16-bit unsigned or 32-bit integer, the pixels are divided by 256. That is, the value range [0,255*256] is mapped to [0,255].
        
    

*
    If the image is 32-bit floating-point, the pixel values are multiplied by 255. That is, the value range [0,1] is mapped to [0,255].
    
    

.. index:: WaitKey

.. _WaitKey:

WaitKey
-------






.. cfunction:: int cvWaitKey( int delay=0 )

    Waits for a pressed key.





    
    :param delay: Delay in milliseconds. 
    
    
    
The function 
``cvWaitKey``
waits for key event infinitely (
:math:`\texttt{delay} <= 0`
) or for 
``delay``
milliseconds. Returns the code of the pressed key or -1 if no key was pressed before the specified time had elapsed.

**Note:**
This function is the only method in HighGUI that can fetch and handle events, so it needs to be called periodically for normal event processing, unless HighGUI is used within some environment that takes care of event processing.
\
\
**[Qt Backend Only]**
qt-specific details:
With this current Qt implementation, this is the only way to process event such as repaint for the windows, and so on 
ldots
