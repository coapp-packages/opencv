<h1>What is OpenCV</h1>

<p>OpenCV means Intel&reg; Open Source Computer Vision Library.
It is a collection of C functions and few C++ classes that implement some
popular algorithms of Image Processing and Computer Vision.</p>

<hr>

<h1>The key features</h1>

<p>OpenCV is cross-platform middle-to-high level API that consists
   of a few hundreds (>300) C functions. It does not rely on external
   numerical libraries, though it can make use of some of them (see below)
   at runtime, if they are available.</p>

<p>OpenCV is free for both non-commercial and commercial use
(see the <a href="license.txt">license</a> for details).</p>

<p><a name="#ipp">OpenCV provides transparent for user interface to Intel&reg; Integrated Performance
Primitives (IPP) (only ippcv for now).</a>
That is, it loads automatically IPP libraries optimized
for specific processor at runtime, if they are available.
More information about IPP can be retrieved at
<a href="http://www.intel.com/software/products/ipp/ippvm20/index.htm">
http://www.intel.com/software/products/ipp/ippvm20/index.htm</a></p>

<p>There are interfaces to OpenCV for some other languages/environments (more to come):
<ul>
<li>EiC - ANSI C interpreter written by Ed Breen.
    AFAIK, it is now abandoned.
    Hawk and CvEnv are the interactive environments (written in MFC and TCL,respectively)
    that embedd EiC interpteter.
<li>Ch - ANSI C/C++ interpreter with some scripting capabilities,
    created and supported by SoftIntegration&reg; company
    (<a href="http://www.softintegration.com">http://www.softintegration.com</a>)
    Wrappers for Ch are located at opencv/interfaces/ch.
<li>MATLAB&reg; - great environment for numerical and symbolic computing by
    Mathworks. MATLAB&reg; interface for some of OpenCV functions
    can be found at opencv/interfaces/matlab/toolbox
</ul>

<h1>Who created it</h1>

<p>Most of the coding work has been done in Intel Research Lab, Nizhny Novgorod, Russia.
The complete list of authors can be found in the file <a href="..\AUTHORS">AUTHORS</a>.</p>

<p>Besides, a lot of people helped with suggestions, patches, bug reports etc.
The incomplete list is in <a href="..\THANKS">THANKS</a> file.<br>

<hr>

<h1>What's New</h1>

<p>The most important things arrived in beta 3 are:
<ul>
<li>Complete up-to-date HTML reference [we hope]
<li>Source code for stereo correspondence.
<li>Robust and fast face detection.
</ul>

<p>See <a href="..\ChangeLog">ChangeLog</a> file for full list of changes.

<h1>Where to get OpenCV</h1>

<p>Go <a href="http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/opencvlibrary">http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/opencvlibrary</a>.
If it does not work, type "OpenCV" in <a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a>.</p>

<h1><a name="troubleshooting">If you have a problem with installing/running/using OpenCV</a></h1>

<ol>
<li>Read <a href="faq.htm">FAQs</a>
<li>Search through OpenCV archives at www.yahoogroups.com
(<a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/OpenCV/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/OpenCV/</a>)
<li>Join OpenCV mailing list at yahoo groups (see FAQs on how to do it) and mail your questions
   (the mailing list will probably migrate to
   <a href="http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/opencvlibrary">OpenCV's SourceForge site</a>)
<li>Look at the OpenCV sample code, read the reference manual :)
</ol>
