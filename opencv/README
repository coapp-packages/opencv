Some important notes about demo apps building:

 The configure script now accepts the --with-apps key which enables/disables 
building of the apps (default is 'yes').
 
 The apps require tcl/tk 8.3 or later that can be download for free from
www.scriptics.com and BWidget widget set (www.unifix-online.com/BWidget/)

 The recommended compiler for the apps is gcc 2.91.66. Cvenv currently can not
be compiled with later versions

 The apps are not installed. Just find their binaries inside there sources
after building
