- higher-level math functions:
    x**y (y = -1, -0.5, 0.5, ... ) in addition to cvbSqrt ...
    carttopolar, polartocart, exp, log

- speed up pyrlk optical flow
- contours with floating-point coordinates
- chains support in contour processing functions (dp approximation, shape analysis)
- better contour comparison functions (contour morphing, housdorph distance ...)
- color to index transform
- contour extraction from multi-level (i.e. paletted) images
- color edge detectors
- graphs from point sets (NNG, MST, RNG ...)
- CvSubdiv2D -> CvGraph conversion
- C++ wrappers (or alternative definitions)
  for CvMat, IplImage, CvHistogram, CvSeq ...
- color floodfill
- speed up template matching (better alighment in simd version)
- operations on contours (point-contour check, contour intersection, contour
  decomposition, contour union)
- min-epsilon contour approximation
- better methods for fundamental matrix calculation
- more general function for covariation matrix calculation
- linear discriminant functions
-
